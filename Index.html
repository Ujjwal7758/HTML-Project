            The coronavirus pandemic is set to rob the global economy of more
            than $5 trillion of growth over the next two years, greater than the
            annual output of Japan. That’s the warning from Wall Street banks as
            the world plunges into its deepest peacetime recession since the
            1930s, after the virus forced governments to demand that businesses
            close and people stay home. Although the downturn is predicted to be
            short-lived, it’ll take time for economies to make up the lost
            ground. Even with unpr ..

            The fear of novel coronavirus spread has driven people to violence.
            After incidences of attacks on health care workers, now an incident
            of mob violence has come forth. In Delhi's Bawana, a group of men
            has been arrested for beating up a youth who had recently returned
            fro Madhya Pradesh. The youth had allegedly hidden his connection to
            Tablighi Jamaat, which has become famous as the superspreader of the
            novel coronavirus in India. Several people who attended a Tablighi
            Jamaat event in Nizammudin Markas in south Delhi last month have
            tested positive for Covid-19 across the nation. However, the youth
            had been staying at a Tablighi Jamaat Markaz in Raisena in Madhya
            Pradesh for past one and a half months. It is not clear if he came
            in contact with any person who has tested positive for novel
            coronavirus there or not. The 22-year-old resident of north Delhi's
            Bawana allegedly came back to his house recently by hiding behind a
            vegetable truck. According to the police, the locals assumed that
            the youth had coronavirus and had come to spread the virus in their
            locality. He was also accused of hiding his connection to Tablighi
            Jamaat, even as the government has clearly directed everyone
            connected to the organisation to come forward. A video of locals
            beating the youth went viral on Sunday, which alerted the
            authorities. In the video, the youth can be seen lying in a pool of
            blood. The police have since taken the youth away and have admitted
            him to LNJP hospital, where he is being kept in a Covid-19 isolation
            ward. His test result is awaited. All three accused, namely Naveen,
            Prashant and Promod, have been arrested for wrongful restraint,
            beating and threatening. Police also registered a case against the
            victim of mob beating for violating lockdown.
